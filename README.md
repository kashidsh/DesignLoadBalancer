Load Balancer
Load balancing provides a higher level of availability and scale by spreading incoming requests across multiple virtual machines (VMs). This quickstart shows you how to deploy an Azure Resource Manager template that creates a Standard load balancer to load balance VMs. Using Resource Manager template takes fewer steps comparing to other deployment methods.

Resource Manager template is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file that defines the infrastructure and configuration for your project. The template uses declarative syntax, which lets you state what you intend to deploy without having to write the sequence of programming commands to create it. If you want to learn more about developing Resource Manager templates, see Resource Manager documentation and the template reference.
